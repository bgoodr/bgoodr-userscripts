* TODO Automatically update Firefox gm_scripts directory

 1. [X] Create link installer: firefox/install_gm_scripts_dir_link.sh
    1. [X] The gm_scripts directory needs to be a link pointing back
       into my cloned git repo, so that I can locally develop scripts
       using a real text editor and not the minimal text editors
       launched by Firefox (gedit?), and the push the changes up to
       github so that I can pull them down to other machines.
       1. Reference material gleaned from
          http://stackoverflow.com/a/30827553/257924
 2. [X] Upload existing scripts to GitHub
 3. [X] Change the namespace to point into the github account
 4. [ ] Find a way to change the installurl and update urls in the
    config.xml to point to the github site and not have the fully
    qualified path to the firefox profile directory.
 5. [ ] Update http://stackoverflow.com/a/30827553/257924 with a
    "Thank You!" answer.
 6. [ ] Continue learning by adding new scripts.
