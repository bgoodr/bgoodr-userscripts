bgoodr-userscripts
==================

Handy userscripts I use, plus a shell script to safely install a link
into the Firefox profile directory so as to allow more efficient
development using my chosen text editor.

Word of caution for those using this approach: If you check in a
.user.js file, you *must* remember to also check in the config.xml
file. That file is changed by the GreaseMonkey Firefox extension.
